# Restaurant Management Organization Database



## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A restaurant is a place where people go to eat diverse types of cuisine, hold parties, and have business lunches. Restaurant management must keep track of customers and employees for legal and communication purposes.
However, relying on paper records can lead to data loss. To avoid this, we created the Restaurant Management Organization Database system. This system assists in the recording of customer information, services, and bills, such as money transfer, banquet hall service details, parking service details, and staff information such as working hours, salary, and personal information.
To meet the needs of users, the system can be easily updated, corrected, and changed. The primary goal of this project is to transition from manual paper-based record keeping to a database system, which reduces manual labor while improving the security of customer and employee data.

## OBJECTIVES

- To book tables for customers based on availability and their preferences. 
- To order any kind of food.  
- Minimize the usage of paper or manual work and move digitally. 
- To record any details of staff, including their personal details and working services and hours.
- To track payment details of customer for the food.
- Records parking service details. 
- Stock inventory maintenance.
- Helps in accepting different modes of payments from customers. 
- Records Details of banquet hall used by customers.

## SCOPE

1. The goal of this project is to switch from conventional paper-based operations to digital ones, which will result in better time management and service quality.
2. Customer access is made easier and their ability to offer feedback or report problems is made more convenient thanks to the automation of processes.
3. Additionally, the system guarantees customer information confidentiality, lowering the possibility of fraud. The system has the option of including real-time tracking.
4. Customer information can be saved for future reference, assisting marketing efforts. Furthermore, the system reduces the possibility of financial mismanagement and facilitates data backup for future use.
5. The system allows for online booking and banquet hall reservations.
6. Management of the workforce, including pay information and service history, is also made simpler and more efficient. 
7. Finally, resource status can be tracked and updated in real time.
